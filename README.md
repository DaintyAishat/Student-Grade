Project overview
You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
Your application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and final score.# Student-Grade
